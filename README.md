# Shelob
A repo to dominate them all...


Compilation of some interesting posts about malware. 

It is only some notes taken while the read of the original source, so donÂ´t take it as dogma; they are just my notes (a poor ignorant)


What does this repository provide? Well, just like Shelob's networks and tunnels, this repo aims to create a bunch of links from reading the most prominent malware reports. That is, not only are the reports referenced, and notes of interest are added; a lot of cross-references to tools, tactics and procedures as well as basic operating system knowledge are also included.
